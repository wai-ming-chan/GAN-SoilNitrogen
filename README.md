# GAN Soil Nitrogen Prediction in Precision Agriculture

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for soil nitrogen prediction in precision agriculture. The model will leverage the power of GANs to generate synthetic soil nitrogen data that can be used to improve the accuracy of nitrogen prediction in agricultural fields.

## Features
- GAN architecture for generating synthetic soil nitrogen data
- Training pipeline for the GAN model
- Evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the model
- Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques
- Visualization of the generated data and prediction results

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GAN-SoilNitrogen.git
